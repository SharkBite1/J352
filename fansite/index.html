<h1>Avengers: Age of a Fan</h1>
<p> Isaiah Hayes <br>
October 2022 



<h1> Introduction </h1>

<h2>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is vast and special to me. The Infinity Saga is something I hold close to my heart becasue of how much of an impact its had onmy as I grew up. The saga has over 20 movies that span over 10 years and it is a complete masterpiece. The saga essentially follows the MCU heroes through their personal paths and stories as they eventually team together in  order to stop Thanos, the Mad Titan. The Infinity Saga would be nothing without the original six Avenger though.</h2>

<p><strong> The initial six, depicted above, are Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Thor Odinson and Clint Barton. They are popularly known as their aliases, Iron Man, Captian America, Black Widow, Hulk, Thor, and Hawkeye respectively. Now I would go into detail about them personally, but if you're here you probably already know the basics: Tony is rich, with a cool suit. Steve is a super soldier with heart. Natasha is a force to be reckoned with. Bruce is always angry (see what I did there?). Thor is a god. And Clint knows his way around a bow and arrow. What I'm really here to talk about are the works of art we call the Avengers movies... </strong>

<h1> The Avengers (2012) </h1>
<img src= "images/newyork.jpeg" title= "Avengers Battle of New York" style= "width: 50%; height:50%; float:right; padding: 0px 10px" >

<p>This is the first move we our beloved heroes in together. Fans were excited to see the dynamics between the original six in terms of how well they worked together, what make them tick, and what friendships they would have within the six. This movie is fast-paced and exciting as we are introduced to Loki, Thor's brother, and his overwhelming need to become a king. The heroes are initiated by Nick Fury to destroy the threats and inherently save the world. From the witty moments to the cliff-hanging drama, this movie is a solid beginning to a world of trouble.</p>

<h1> Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) </h1>
<img src= "images/ultron.jpg" title= "Age of Ultron!" style= "width: 35%; height:35%; float:left; padding: 0px 10px" >

<p>*Evil Laugh* Remember when I said a world of trouble? Yeah. It starts here. This sequel is more than just your average sequel. The film drops us into the growing relationship between the heroes as well as introduce us to more. We dive into the problem of Tony being too smart for his own good, causing his creation to turn on the team and literally try to destroy the world. This time, the threat is an ever-changing problem of Ultron. He is basically a robot of human extinction. This is one of the best sequels in the MCU becuase of how significant its plot points are for the Infinity Saga as a whole. During the move, we meet Vision, Pietro (Quicksilver) and Wanda Maximoff (later known as Scarlet Witch). </p>

<h1> Avengers: Infinity War (2018) </h1>
<img src= "images/infinity.jpeg" title= "Infinity War" style= "width: 50%; height:50%; float:right; padding: 0px 10px" >

<p>This. Movie. Was. A. Masterpiece. To say the absolute <strong> LEAST </strong>. Not only did this movie come out three years later, it was the beginning of the end for our heroes. And yet, we all had no clue. The movie brings together every hero we were introduced to in the years prior. Including, but not limited to: Ant Man, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel. Not only does this film change everything we know about the MCU, it enhances it. We get random humor from the Guardians, intensity from all sides, and cultural diversity from Wakanda (which we all know HAS to be real). As we follow Thanos' journey to get all the infinity stones in his menacingly large gauntlet, we also see our heroes divided and fighting on different stages becuase of the division from Civil War (see honorable mention). Fighting in space, through bifrosts, and in hidden kingdoms are things we never thought we'd see in the MCU, and yet they all took place at once. *Chef's Kiss* </p>

<h1> Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h1>
<img src= "images/endgame.jpeg" title= "Endgame" style= "width: 50%; height:50%; float:left; padding: 0px 10px" >

<p>And here we are. The end. This three hour rollercoaster of emotions is something I still have not recovered from. If you couldn't tell by now, I love my heroes, and to see an end to their collective story is gut-wrenching. But, this movie did not only exceed anyone's expectations, it demolished everyone's motivation to watch another Marvel movie ever again (Of course until Spider-man: No Way Home woke the fanbase back up). Anyway, this film right after the last. It was a continuation of the fight for the stones, but after the heroes lost. The film builds on the loss that both the audience and heroes are feeling by not only adding more loss but giving the audience what they came for: Closure. As we closed the book on our childhood, we open the book to a whole new multiverse of possibility. After the death of Tony, we all realized that anyhting is possible. </p>

<h1> Honorable Mention... Captian America: Civil War (2016) </h1>
<img src= "images/civilwar.jpeg" title= "Civil War" style= "width:20%; height:20%; float:left; padding: 0px 10px" >


<p>As an honorable mention, I'll keep it short and sweet. Captian America: Civil War was more than another installment to the Captian America stand-alones, it is a complete shift of pace from before. Our heroes have a rift stemming from no other than differences between their leaders: Tony and Steve. This movie set the scene for Infinity War, while also showing the audience that high tensions plus insane abilities equal complete anarchy. </p>
