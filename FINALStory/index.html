<p>University of Maryland implemented TerrapinSTRONG to improve student participation and multicultural inclusion at the university, and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion invited dozens of multicultural student organizations to join this initiative. </p>

<p>TerrapinSTRONG is a program that university president Darryll Pines implemented in August 2021 to create an inclusive student body and campus culture. </p>

<p>“TerrapinSTRONG is the shared understanding from which we work to improve the sense of community, connection and inclusion on our campus,” according to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.</p>

<p>The University of Maryland has an immensely diverse student body. As of November 2022, the undergraduate body is composed of about 50 percent minority students, according to the university’s Office Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment.</p>

<p> With such a large minority presence on campus, TerrapinSTRONG works with minority student leaders from numerous campus organizations to make campus a safe and comfortable space for this vast and growing minority population.</p>

<p>The program invited over 30 different organizations, with over half being organizations that represent the Black-identifying undergraduate students on campus. From historically black fraternities and sororities of the National Pan-Hellenic Council to major-related academic organizations like Code: Black and The Black Business Association.</p>

<p>The minority student population on campus for fall 2022 is made up of 12.6% African American students. This is the second largest minority population on campus, according to data from the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. </p>

<p>Ania Swann, an information science and communications major, is a member of the Black Student Union (BSU) on campus. She believes the organization is effectively doing their part in providing an inclusive environment for African American students on campus to find others just like them and make long-lasting connections. </p>

<h5>“I've seen so many people that are like me, [who] go through the same struggles as me, [who] come from the same background as me, [and the] same type of household as me,” Swann said.</h5>

<p>Through the BSU, she was able to meet people she felt came from a similar background as her. BSU works in conjunction with the goals of TerrapinSTRONG to provide an inclusive space for Black students to make connections with each other.</p>



<p>“TerrapinSTRONG brings marginalized voices to the table and clearly communicates our commitment to be a welcoming and safe place,” according to the TerrapinSTRONG website. </p>

<p>Mason Minus, a sophomore and president of the BSU, was a member of the freshman council during his first year. He said he joined to make a lasting impression on the Black student population on campus and plans on working to continue the legacy as president. </p>

<p>“I think that in many ways, we're building on that sense of community that the Black Student Union had previously had in addition to that we're being able to innovate our own ideas,” Minus said. </p>

<p>This university’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion also implemented the TerrapinSTRONG initiative as an onboarding course for faculty, students and all other staff to complete. </p>

<p>The onboarding course is meant to “create a more cohesive identity and a stronger commitment to community, connection and inclusion,” according to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. </p> 
<p>Within the last year, almost 80% of enrolled undergraduates completed the course, and over 75% said they were more excited about attending the university after completing the onboarding course.  </p>

<p>Moving towards the future, this university plans on growing the TerrapinSTRONG initiative beyond what it does now. UMD wants to engage more of the campus community with action plans from the initiative. </p>

<p>In addition to currently having TerrapinSTRONG representatives in each campus department, the university wants to develop a TerrapinSTRONG 2.0 to “enhance learning around inclusion and inclusive practices.” </p>
